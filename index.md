- 🤓 I'm a geological engineer and an amateur Python 🐍 developer. I hold a master's degree in Geotechnical Engineering, and I'm currently doing a PhD in Engineering.
- 🔍 My current research is focused on landslides 🏔️ hazard assessment, considering both rainfall 🌦️ and earthquakes 🪨 as triggering factors.
- 📚 I have studied block-in-matrix materials (bimrocks and bimsoils), especially the tortuous failure surface developed in these materials and its consideration in slope stability.
- I have worked in consulting as a geologist and geotechnical engineer 👷‍♂️. I have indoor experience in the office 🧑‍💻 and lab 👨‍🔬 and have done a lot of fieldwork 🗺️🏕️⛰️.
