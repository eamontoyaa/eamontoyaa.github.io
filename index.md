Welcome to my personal website!

## These are some nerdy and fun facts about me

- 🛫 I come from Colombia 🇨🇴<!--, but I'm currently living in France 🇫🇷. -->
- 😼 I have 4 cats 🐈‍⬛ and love drinking coffee ☕.
- I practice beach volleyball 🏐 and table tennis 🏓. I also enjoy watching football ⚽.
- 🤓 I'm a geological engineer with a master's degree in geotechnical engineering and a PhD in engineering.
- 🔍 My current research focuses on slope stability 💻, landslide hazard 🏔️, rainfall thresholds ⛈, and early warning systems 🚦.
- 📚 In my PhD, I studied landslides induced by earthquakes through the implementation of physics-based numerical frameworks at regional and local scales.
- 📚 In my master's, I studied block-in-matrix materials (bimrocks and bimsoils), their tortuous failure surfaces, and their implication on slope stability.
- 👷‍♂️ I have worked in consulting as an engineering geologist and geotechnical engineer.
- 💻 I'm passionate about developing open-source software to solve engineering problems, but also as a teaching tool 🧑‍🏫. I usually program in Python 🐍, but I also have basic knowledge of R and Matlab/Octave.
- 🤝 I'm looking for people to collaborate with on open-source development and research projects. All ideas 💡 are welcome!
